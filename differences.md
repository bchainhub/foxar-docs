Differences:

Foxar is a fork of foundry so most of the functionality works the same except for couple instances:

    PrivateKey is no longer uint256, now it is string memory since ed-448 private key is longer than 32 bytes,
    so we have to use string. So any of the following cheat codes donâ€™t accept uint256 but accepts string memory.
    Here are the cheatcodes and parts of the spark-std that were changed

    ```solidity
        struct Wallet {
            address addr;
            string publicKey;
            string privateKey;
        }

        function sign(string memory privateKey, bytes32 digest) external returns (bytes memory sig);

        function addr(string memory privateKey) external returns (address);

        function startBroadcast(string memory privateKey) external;

        // Generates a wallet from the private key and returns the wallet
        function createWallet(string memory privateKey) external returns (Wallet memory);

        // Generates a wallet from the private key, labels the account with that name, and returns the wallet
        function createWallet(string memory privateKey, string calldata name) external returns (Wallet memory);
    ```


    Because in core each network has different address prefixes, foxar needs to know the network you want to deploy to as a cli argument.
    So whenever you want to deploy foxar needs --network flag.

    There are 3 options:
    --network 1: Is Mainnet
    --network 3: is Devin
    --network >=4 : is a private network

Not supported:
Cheatcodes: deriveKey() are currently not supported

Verifying your contracts isn't currently supported by blockbook or by foxar. We are planning to add this in the future.
